#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository</u>
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
Detailed theory is provided by considering all the aspects which develops intuition and deeper understanding of concepts, also reference will be provided for further information. In order to understand the process followed in simulation a complete set of procedure will be provided which helps the students to perform simulation. Step by step procedure which is carried out in lab manually is being simulated which gives exposure to real laboratory apparatus, empowering independent learning. Pre-quiz and post-quiz will be provided to test the understanding of the students before and after performing the experiments. Assignment questions will be provided to the students to make them explore more on the experiments. Once the students go through the virtual lab experiments, they can perform those experiments in real lab effectively.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.|See the displayed objectives and Experimental setup then click on next button.  |Display objective and experimental setup used in the experiment |Recall the experiment
2.|Click on Bunsen Burner to heat the specimen to pouring temperature |Display the pouring temperature selected |To identify the temperature at which specimen is heated
3.|Click on specimen to pour it to the mould and allow it to cool at specified temperature. Click next Button to proceed |Display the mould and temperature at which specimen in mould is cooled |Preparing the specimen for the test
4.|Click on mould and needle to place them on the Penetration apparatus and adjust the knob such that the needle just touches the top of the specimen. Click next Button to proceed |Display the mould and needle to be placed in the apparatus |To place the specimen in experimental setup
5.|Click on pointer to set the dial gauge reading to zero |Display the initial dial reading |To set initial dial reading
6.|Click to release the needle to plunge into specimen for 5sec and note down the final reading and penetration value. Repeat above steps for 3 trials. Click next. |Display the final dial reading and penetration value |To calculate penetration value
7.|View the results of experiment for different trial |Display the results of the experiment |To view results of the experiment
